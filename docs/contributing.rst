Set Up
======

Create a virtualenv_ and install Django with pip_::

    $ pip install Django


Running the Tests
=================

Running the tests is as easy as::

    $ ./run.sh test

You may also run the test on multiple versions of Django using tox.

- First install tox::

    $ pip install tox

- Then run the tests with tox::

    $ tox


Code Standards
==============

I ask two things for pull requests.

* The flake8_ tool must not report any violations.
* All tests, including new tests where appropriate, must pass.
